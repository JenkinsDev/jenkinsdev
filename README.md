## Well, hey there! 👋

I'm David Jenkins! Great to have you dropping by! Here's just a bit about me, if you're interested:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Playful Rewards](https://playfulrewards.com/), [UserWise](https://userwise.io), & [Byte-Sized Bits](https://bytesizedbits.com)
- 🎮 I'm a pretty avid gamer, with a love of almost any genre. Two core favorites from my lifetime are World of Warcraft & Halo
- 💭 I'm always pondering and trying to learn new things
  - 🌱 I’m currently focused on expanding my knowledge around physical electronics, in order to accelerate Byte-Sized Bits.
- 👪 Father to beautiful children
- 🌐 I share my [(rough) public notes with the world](https://jenkinsdev.us/public-notes/) (new-ish endeavor)
